# ðŸ“š Book Notes Web App â€“ Capstone Project

## Overview
Inspired by Derek Siversâ€™ book notes site, this project helps you remember what you read by letting you take notes, rate books, and view them online. Youâ€™ll build a web app to store and display your book summaries.

## Objectives
- Use public APIs in a web project
- Practice Express/Node.js server-side coding
- Perform full CRUD with PostgreSQL

## Features
- Fetch book covers using the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers)
- Add, edit, delete, and view book entries
- Sort by rating, title, or recency
- Display in a clean UI like [sive.rs/book](https://sive.rs/book)

## Requirements
- **Database:** Use PostgreSQL + `pg` for data persistence
- **Backend:** Express.js + Node.js
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS + EJS templating
- **API:** Integrate with Open Library via Axios
- **Planning:** Database schema + draw.io diagram
- **Error Handling:** Console log + user-friendly messages
- **Docs:** Comment code and write a `README.md`
- **GitHub:** Push your code and share it!

## Setup
```bash
npm install
nodemon index.js
